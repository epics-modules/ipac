<H2>GreenSpring Octal Serial Driver Release Notes</H2>
<P>Software by <I>Peregrine McGehee</I><BR>
Release by <I>Andrew Johnson</I></P>
</CENTER>

<P>This document describes changes made to Peregrine McGehee's vxWorks driver
for the GreenSpring Octal RS232/RS422/RS485 IndustryPack modules  since this
driver was merged into the unbundled EPICS ipac support area.  Version numbers
refer to the release of the ipac support software as a whole.  The earliest
version appears at the bottom, with more recent releases above it. </P><HR>

<H2>Version 2.6</H2>

<P>Added:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Support for the ioctls <tt>SIO_HW_OPTS_SET</tt> and <tt>SIO_BAUD_SET</tt>
(defined in the vxWorks header file sioLib.h).</LI>

<LI>EPICS iocsh command tables and a registrar routine.</LI>

<LI>The database definition file <tt>tyGSOctal.dbd</tt>.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Changed:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Minor internal surgery/refactoring, including removal of unnecessarily
exported routines from the API.</LI>

<LI>The type returned from tyGSOctalDevCreate() is now the char* name argument.
The first argument to tyGSOctalConfig() is now also the char* name for the
device.  This change should be backwards compatible for all IOCs where the
initialization was being performed in the vxWorks startup script, but now
allows a slightly different set of initialization commands to be used from
either the vxWorks shell or the EPICS iocsh.</LI>

<LI>This code now compiles to a library rather than an object file so the
method of linking it into an IOC application now matches other EPICS R3.14.x
support applications.</LI>

</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Version 2.5</H2>

<P>Added:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Support for the ioctl FIOBAUDRATE, needed for MPF.</LI>

<LI>Mark the IP slot active at initialization time, and inactive again in the
reboot hook routine.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Bugs Fixed:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Modified the reboot hook routine to fix a race condition.</LI>

</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Version 2.3</H2>

<P>Changed:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Modified documentation to indicate non-support of the new IP-OctalPlus
module family, which uses different UARTS.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Added:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Burkhard W. Kolb's RebootHook routine to turn off interrupts.</LI>

</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Version 2.1</H2>

<P>Updated due to changes made to drvIpac, and also actually tried it out for
myself - got some interrupts but I haven't done a full test.</P>

<P>Changed:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Use <TT>ipmIntConnect()</TT> to attach the ISR. </LI>

</UL>

<P>Bugs fixed:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Now works with the ipmv162 carrier driver - the interrupt vector register
was being accessed at an offset from the I/O space, which works on GreenSpring
carriers but doesn't meet the IPAC specification.  The register is correctly
accessed in the IP memory space, which means that this must be mapped in.</LI>

</UL>

<HR>
<H2>Version 2.0</H2>

<P>First version containing this driver, ipac support is now structured as an
EPICS R3.13.1 &lt;supporttop&gt; application.</P>

<P>Added:</P>

<UL>

<LI>This driver software and these release notes.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Bugs fixed:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Gcc compilation warnings attended to.</LI>

</UL>
